SpotifyTrackAnalysis
"Spotify Track Analysis EDA Project"

Overview
This project conducts an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a large Spotify Tracks dataset containing diverse audio features such as danceability, energy, loudness, valence, and tempo. The analysis aims to reveal how these musical characteristics impact a song’s popularity and extract meaningful trends from the data.

Objectives
Analyze the Spotify dataset to uncover key audio features driving song popularity.

Understand patterns and relationships between musical attributes and listener engagement.

Provide insights to help improve music recommendations and content strategies.

1. Importing Required Libraries
Use libraries such as pandas (data manipulation), numpy (numerical computation), matplotlib and seaborn (visualizations).

Example:

python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
2. Import All the Necessary Datasets
Load all Spotify-related CSV files (tracks, features, or metadata) into pandas DataFrames.

Confirm successful loading using print statements, .head() or .info() to preview structure.

Example:

python
df_tracks = pd.read_csv('tracks.csv')
df_features = pd.read_csv('features.csv')
print(df_tracks.shape)
print(df_features.head())


3. Visualizing & Summarizing the Dataset
Display the first few rows: df.head()

Summarize data types and missing values: df.info()

Describe key statistics: df.describe()

Show dataset size: df.shape

Example insights: Number of tracks, columns, presence of nulls.

4. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Handle missing values: fill with substitute text or mean/median for appropriate columns.

Remove duplicate records: df.drop_duplicates()

Fix incorrect data types: convert columns using astype().

Standardize data for analysis (e.g., convert milliseconds to seconds).

5. Exploratory Data Analysis – Univariate Analysis
Use histograms, boxplots, KDE plots for distributions of features (danceability, popularity, valence, etc.).

Use count plots/bar charts for categorical features (genre, artist, time signature).

Example plots:

sns.histplot(df['popularity'])

sns.boxplot(x=df['danceability'])

6. Bivariate Analysis
Compare numerical and categorical variables (e.g., boxplot of popularity by genre).

Use violin plots, grouped bar charts, or summary tables to show differences.

Example:

sns.boxplot(x='genre', y='popularity', data=df)

7. Multivariate Analysis
Show correlations between features: correlation matrix, heatmap (sns.heatmap()).

Use pairplots (sns.pairplot(df)) to visualize interactions.

Example: Analyze how danceability and energy together influence popularity.

8. Time Series Analysis – KPI Growth Trends
Calculate year-over-year (YoY) changes for metrics such as popularity, track release counts.

Visualize with line graphs.

Example:

Group data by 'release_year', plot average popularity over time.

9. Outlier Detection and Analysis
Apply IQR technique: identify and visualize outliers using boxplots.

Example: Report tracks with unusually high or low popularity/danceability.

10. Final Insights & Strategic Recommendations
Summarize key findings: e.g., mainstream tracks are highly danceable, most are in 4/4 time, popularity is right-skewed.

Suggest actions: improve recommendation system, target content for popular genres.

Example: "Focus marketing on songs with mid to high danceability, as these dominate listener preferences."

11. Limitations & Future Directions
Mention dataset gaps: missing values, time range, genre imbalance.

Suggest future work: deeper artist-level analysis, machine learning models for prediction, trending analysis.
